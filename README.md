AdsPower Profile Automation Bot
A Python-based automation script designed to automate the creation, configuration, and management of browser profiles in the AdsPower desktop application. This bot is built for resilience, handling dynamic data, validation, and data logging to streamline workflows.
Key Features
Automated Application Launch: The script intelligently launches the AdsPower application, waiting for the main dashboard to be ready before proceeding.
Dynamic Profile Creation: Creates browser profiles in a fully automated loop, respecting the application's limits by working in batches.
Intelligent Form Filling: Automates the filling of all necessary fields, including Profile Name and a randomized User-Agent.
Robust Proxy Handling:
Parses a proxy template string to fill Host, Port, Username, and Password.
Generates a new random session ID for the proxy username for each attempt.
Features a persistent retry loop to find a valid proxy connection, preventing failures from a single bad IP.
Reliable Data Extraction: Uses a stable Clipboard Method to copy the IP address after a successful proxy check, avoiding the unreliability of OCR.
Data Logging: Saves the details of every successfully created profile (including the assigned IP) to a timestamped CSV file, organized in a dedicated ipslist folder.
Automated Cleanup: After creating a batch of profiles, the script automatically deletes them to make space for the next batch, allowing for near-infinite scalability.
Modular & Organized Code: The project is structured with separate modules for automation logic (automator), data manipulation (helper), and configuration (constants), making it easy to read and maintain.
Tech Stack
Python 3.9+
PyAutoGUI: For core GUI automation (mouse and keyboard control).
Pyperclip: For robustly reading data from the system clipboard.
